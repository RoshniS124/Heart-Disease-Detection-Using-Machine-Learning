# Heart-Disease-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning
This project predicts the presence of heart disease in a patient based on medical attributes using machine learning models. It features a web-based interface built with Streamlit for ease of use by non-technical users.
 Project Overview

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death globally. Early detection and diagnosis can save lives. This machine learning model helps predict heart disease using a variety of patient data inputs such as age, cholesterol level, blood pressure, and more.

Objectives

- Develop a machine learning model to predict heart disease.
- Create a simple web app to input user data and display predictions.
- Visualize key relationships in the data to aid in understanding.
- Make the solution accessible via GitHub and optionally host it online.

Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy** – data manipulation
- **Scikit-learn** – machine learning
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – data visualization
- **Git & GitHub** – version control and sharing
Dataset

Dataset used: [UCI Heart Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ronitf/heart-disease-uci)

This dataset contains 13 features such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, etc., used to predict the `target` (presence or absence of heart disease).
